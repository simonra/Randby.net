                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>The platform team was tasked with providing the developers with a common platform, and support them in their use thereof.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="work-experience-instance-tech">
                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p>Our main concern was supporting the runtime platform, which was the on-prem <span class="keyword">Kubernetes</span> clusters. This involved regularly diving into the <span class="keyword">Docker</span> images belonging to the different teams, as well as our own. We also worked with standardizing the <span class="keyword">GitLab CI/CD</span> pipelines for the builds, as well as <span class="keyword">ArgoCD</span> for the Kubernetes deployments. We were maintaining a product and documentation catalog written in <span class="keyword">Go</span>, contributing heavily to an internal multi kubernetes cluster management tool also written in Go. We also set up a shared <span class="keyword">OpenTelemetry</span> infrastructure, and guided teams in adopting the use of it from their applications. As well as supporting the other teams adaptation and use of <span class="keyword">Kafka</span>.</p>

                <h4>Role</h4>
                <p>As a <span class="keyword">developer</span>, the role involved contributing code to the tooling we made, but also staking out the direction for the platform and it's usage. To some extent it involved assisting other developers getting their code up and running, both on our infrastructure, but also in their local dev environments. Finally, a large part of it was getting the teams up to speed with Kafka, as well as helping them debug the trickier problems.</p>

                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>The data hub team worked with establishing a data hub for the organization. The goal was to have a platform that enabled the product teams to have a reliable, yet easy to use, distributed data store, that should scale well as the amount of data grows, as well as facilitating collaboration with other teams about the data. The project evaluated different technologies, proof of concept-ed the platform from installation to operations to usage management, procured licenses for operations support and tooling for the development teams, as well as handing over the established infrastructure to the operations team. It also involved working with other development teams on the adaptation, as well as the product and business management to work out how to best utilize the platform we were establishing to deliver more value at less cost. We also had extensive dialog with the legal department on how we could enable more secure treatment of data.</p>

            <section class="work-experience-instance-tech">
                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p>The core work was setting up <span class="keyword">Kafka</span> and securing it with <span class="keyword">mTLS</span>, as well as creating a small management tool in <span class="keyword">C#</span> to manage it, which we ran in <span class="keyword">Kubernetes</span>. We found Kafka to be a very forgiving piece of infrastructure to operate at a small scale, so we had time to do a good job with the public/government procurement process that would enable us to have better tooling than what we'd have time to maintain in house, as well as proper support for the operations teams when they'd take over the operations. The final tooling gave us an opportunity to explore integrations between <span class="keyword">Blazor</span>, <span class="keyword">Keycloak</span>, and <span class="keyword">Apicurio</span>. We also worked a lot with creating creating usage examples for various scenarios, both in <span class="keyword">dotnet</span> and <span class="keyword">Java</span> which many of the teams used, but also hosting and running <span class="keyword">Kafka Connectors</span>. Finally we also set up <span class="keyword">OpenTelemetry</span> integrations directly with Kafka, and worked on increasing the adaptation of OpenTelemetry among the development teams.</p>

                <h4>Role</h4>
                <p>Even though I was a <span class="keyword">developer</span>, and produced a fair bit of code both for tooling and examples/starting points for the development teams, the high impact from the work came from the dialog with the rest of the organization.</p>

                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>The project was concerned with replacing the Norwegian health care sectors copy of the National Population Register, because the Norwegian Tax Administration were deprecating the old API. To achieve this in a more resilient, and less resource intensive fashion, the project built the new solution to be cloud native. However, when the Schrems 2 GDPR judgement fell, we migrated it to run on prem.</p>

                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p>Initially, I worked a lot with the <span class="keyword">Azure Pipelines</span>, as well as the <span class="keyword">Azure Pipelines</span> fetching data from the Tax Administrations <span class="keyword">National Population Register APIs</span>. The code was mostly <span class="keyword">C#</span>, integrating with <span class="keyword">Microsoft SQL Server</span> and <span class="keyword">Azure Service Bus</span>. As the project matured, we adapted <span class="keyword">Docker</span> and <span class="keyword">Kubernetes</span> for the runtime, initially on <span class="keyword">AKS</span> tightly integrated with <span class="keyword">Azure Key Vault</span>, later <span class="keyword">Hashicorp Vault</span>. We worked on automating all of it with <span class="keyword">Terraform</span> and the <span class="keyword">Azure Resource Manager</span> templates.</p>

                <h4>Role</h4>
                <p>As the sole non-consultant <span class="keyword">developer</span>, initially my role focused heavily on the adaptation of Azure as a tool for the organization together with the Operations division. This was interesting because the developers had not previously had access to production infrastructure to this degree. As the project went on, I took on the responsibilities of the <span class="keyword">Quality Champion</span>, then also the <span class="keyword">Security Architect</span>, and finally the <span class="keyword">Security Champion</span> as they moved on to other projects.</p>

The solution had a diverse set of front end technologies, spanning <span class="keyword">.NET MVC</span>, <span class="keyword">jQuery</span>, <span class="keyword">AngularJS</span> and <span class="keyword">Angular</span>. Parts of the front end were managed through <span class="keyword">Microsofts IIS</span> web server.

                <p>As the <span class="keyword">Tech Lead</span> I was still mostly focused on development. However, my role also entailed working out the way forward for the product together with owners at the department of health. Further, I maintained the Development and Architecture Departments CI/CD servers and services (TFS), device management (AD), VPN (pfSense), dev network (haproxy), dev/test server infrastructure (mostly Windows Server and SQL Server), and managing the organizations presence on GitHub for public API contracts. I got to participate in most of the more arcane debugging (occasional memory dumps from crashes in production from the Operations department, self patching data proxies installed at customers), as well as contributing to a large portion of the code reviews.</p>

                <p>I worked part time besides the university studies in a mid sized team with making and maintaining <a href="https://samfundet.no">samfundet.no</a>, the web site of the student's society in Trondheim. The main focus was being a highly accessible front page for the students to get information, news about events, and buying tickets (through our internally developed payment provider as the society had much time to become PCI DSS compliant, but not much money to spend on someones certified stack), as well as creating a easy to use content management backend for the marketing people.</p>
